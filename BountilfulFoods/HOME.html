                <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast -->
                The coast, also known as the coastline or seashore, 
                is defined as the area where land meets the ocean,
                 or as a line that forms the boundary between the land 
                 and the coastline.Shores are influenced by the topography 
                 of the surrounding landscape, as well as by water induced erosion, 
                 such as waves. The geological composition of rock and soil dictates 
                 the type of shore which is created. The Earth has around 
                 620,000 kilometres (390,000 mi) of coastline. Coasts are 
                 important zones in natural ecosystems, often home to a wide r
                 ange of biodiversity. On land, they harbor important 
                 ecosystems such as freshwater or estuarine wetlands, which 
                 are important for bird populations and other terrestrial 
                 animals. In wave-protected areas they harbor saltmarshes, 
                 mangroves or seagrasses, all of which can provide nursery 
                 habitat for finfish, shellfish, and other aquatic species.
                Rocky shores are usually found along exposed coasts 
                 and provide habitat for a wide range of sessile animals (e.g. 
                 mussels, starfish, barnacles) and various kinds of seaweeds. 
                 In physical oceanography, a shore is the wider fringe that is 
                 geologically modified by the action of the body of water past 
                 and present, while the beach is at the edge of the shore, 
                 representing the intertidal zone where there is one.[5] Along 
                 tropical coasts with clear, nutrient-poor water, coral reefs 
                 can often be found between depths of 1–50 meters (3.3–164.0 feet).
