            <p class="top-text">
                Carlsbad’s earliest residents were the  Luiseño Indians who 
                settled the coastal area. The Luiseño people were successful 
                in living off the land using a number of natural resources to 
                provide food and clothing. They had a close relationship with 
                their natural environment. They used many of the native plants, 
                harvesting many kinds of seeds, berries, nuts, fruits, and vegetables 
                for a varied and nutritious diet. The land also was inhabited by many 
                different species of animals which the men hunted for game and skins. 
                Hunters took antelopes, bobcats, deer, elk, foxes, mice, mountain lions, 
                rabbits, wood rats, river otters, ground squirrels, and a wide variety of 
                insects.  These Native Americans people were here at the time of the first 
                contacts with the Spanish in the 16th century.
                The Spanish missions in California comprise a series of 21 religious outpost 
                were established between 1769 and 1833. The missions led to the creation of 
                the New Spain province of Alta California and were part of the expansion of 
                the Spanish Empire into the most northern and western parts of Spanish North America.
                In 1821, Mexico achieved independence from Spain, taking Alta California 
                along with it, but the missions maintained authority over native people 
                and control of land holdings until the 1830s. The Alta California government 
                secularized the missions after the passage of the Mexican secularization act 
                of 1833. This divided the mission lands into land grants, which became many 
                of the Ranchos of California. During the Mexican period, in 1842, the southern 
                portion of Carlsbad, was granted as Rancho Agua Hedionda to Juan María Marrón.

                In the 1882 Captain John Frazier dug a well near the coast in Carlsbad. He 
                began offering his water at the train station and soon the whistle-stop became 
                known as Frazier’s Station. A test done on a second fresh-water well discovered 
                the water to be chemically similar to that found in some of the most renowned 
                spas in the world, and the town was named after the famed spa in the Bohemian town of Karlsbad.
